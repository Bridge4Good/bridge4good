# Bridge4Good

Bridge4Good is dedicated to connecting homeless shelters with the resources they need during COVID-19. Donations are collected through online purchases through our website, so donors are not risking exposure to COVID-19 when donating.

Shelters are able to create posts detailing the exact items and quantities they need so users know exactly where their money goes.

Our platform also helps support small businesses during these trying times. Small businesses can add web addresses to the shelters' posts where the necessary products are sold online so that donors can purchase items remotely. Bridge4Good will help small businesses generate income during these trying times.
