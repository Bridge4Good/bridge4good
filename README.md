# Bridge4Good

## Problem

Homeless shelters are experiencing a shortage of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) as well as necessities such as food and hygiene products and are in dire need of donations as more and more people living on the streets look to them for resources during the COVID-19 pandemic.


## Solution: Bridge4Good

Bridge4Good is a website dedicated to connecting homeless shelters with the resources they need during COVID-19. Donations are collected through online purchases through our website, so donors are not risking exposure to COVID-19 when donating. 

Shelters can register with our website and post detailing the exact items and quantities they need so users know exactly where their money goes. 

Our platform also helps support local small businesses during these trying times. Local businesses can add web addresses to the shelters' posts indicating where the necessary products are sold online so that donors can purchase items remotely. Bridge4Good will help small businesses generate income during these trying times. 

## Design + Build

We used **Marvel** to mock up our front-end design, **scikit-learn** for machine learning algorithms, and **Flask** to deploy the back-end functionality. 
Using **logistic regression**, a **machine learning algorithm**, we took into account a donor’s **location** and **donation amount** in order to match donors to their **best-fit shelter**. 
We are **not** integrating any **personally identifiable information**, only the **first three digits** of each donor's zipcode and the amount of money they wish to donate.

## Business Model

Homeless shelters are able to better reach community members through our website, and local businesses are able to generate revenue during these trying times.

We will be using subscriptions and transaction fees for the growth and development of Bridge4Good.

## Next Steps

Going forward we plan on further using machine learning to match shelters with a **target group** of donors based on demographic information along with an analysis of donors’ **past activity** to predict future donation patterns. 

We also plan on expanding the platform to **iOS and Android** users and advertise the platform via search engines such as Google and through Instagram, Facebook, and other social media sites with platforms dedicated to social good such as **@goodnews_movement** and **@tanksgoodnews**.
