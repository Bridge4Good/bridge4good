<h1>Bridge4Good</h1>
<h2>A digital platform that allows you to support homeless populations</h2>
<p><b>Help homeless populations during the COVID-19 pandemic without leaving the comfort of your home, and know who and where you are helping. YOU have control over how your donations are used.</b></p>
<p><a href="http://www.bridge4good.com">Get Started</a></p>
<h2>How it Works</h2>
<p><b>Together, we can build the bridge to provide help</b></p>
<p>First, you donate items from Bridge4Good, paying for items a homeless shelter indicates they are in need of</p>
<p>Next, goods will be directly purchased from small businesses, who will mail the goods to homeless shelters</p>
<p>Finally, a homeless shelter receives products you have donated and will distribute the goods to homeless populations</p>
<h2>Where do we operate></h2>
<p><b>Everywhere in the United States</b></p>
<p>The United States has the most COVID-19 cases internationally with over 1 MILLION cases. Homeless populations are the most vulnerable population during this difficultan unpredictable time, and they need YOUR help.</p>
