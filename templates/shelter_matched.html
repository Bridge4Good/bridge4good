            We are running logistic regression analysis in the backend to 
			generate probabilistic insights in order to match homeless shelters with 
			a targeted group of donors based on their location, the amount they are donating, 
			their age, and their history of volunteer work.

		<p> You have been successfully matched with donors! </p>
